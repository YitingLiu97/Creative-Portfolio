                <p>All Connecting is an interactive video sculpture that exposes the systems to the users when they make
                    search requests online in real-time. It visualizes the flow of packets transmitting between
                    performers in the video and servers in real-time. This project is a reinterpretation for The Wave
                    (1965) by Hans Haacke.

                    representations for the systems in the digital world in terms of information exchange and attention
                    exchange.

                <p>We started off by the recent exhibition of his All Connected at the New Museum.
                </p>

                <p>It was mentioned that Haacke was inspired by the ‘System Esthetics’ by Jack Burnham that analyzed the
                    influence of Ludwig von Bertalanffy’s General System Theory (1968) on 20th century sculpture.

                    <li>telepole and wires underground </li>

                <p>We were talking about how each request from the web browser generated several packages on the
                    back-end. We wanted to visualize the amount of packages through projection mapping since this
                    digital system is always happening yet not being presented as is to the users. </p>

                <p>I was looking to get the packets from Max and I tried several methods: OSC and external CNMET, Node
                    for Max, MaxURL. However, it didn’t work for me to get the packet data from any website.

                </p>

                <p>OSC and external CNMET don’t work with my Max which was unfortunate. I used Node for Max and tried
                    several npm libraries such as curl, http, request, and pcap (sort of work). MaxURL is good for
                    getting the html content from a certain website.

                <p>I worked mainly on getting the packet data from the computer to processing.

                    I then started working with processing using Carnivore library to get the packet data. I worked on
                    getting the IP address of the receiver and sender address and compare if it is processed through my
                    computer’s ip address. We will have 16 pipes, 8 pipes of information will be going from the sender
                    to the receiver while the rest will be vice versa. </p>

                <p>I wrote some code to help divide the ip address into 8 sections. Since the first part of the IP
                    address has a range of 0-255(reference), I made sure each part has the range of 255/8. I wrote a
                    function in processing to get all the information needed to return the text as a string which will
                    be transported into madmapper. Below shows the packet information in the console in Processing. <a

                <p>We used Syphon to project the processing content and used MadMapper to map different pipes of
                    corresponding sections of packet data.
